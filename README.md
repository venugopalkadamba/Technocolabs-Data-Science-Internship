## Mini Project 1
<b>Data Analysis on Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing Dataset</b><br>
Under this project we had to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing Dataset and had to statistically prove the importance of washing hands before surgery to prevent child bed fever.

## Mini Project 2
Under this project we were given a credit card dataset for 30000 customers, which contained the past 6 months credit history of customers. Our task was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the Data, derive valuable insights from the data and build a machine learning model that can predict whether the customer will default next month or not.<br>

## Final Project
American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures. Our task was to build a Deep Learning Model to classify the Hand Signs into English alphabets. The model which we built can classify 10 Hand signs into their alphabets with 99% accuracy.<br>
